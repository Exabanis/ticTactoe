# ticTactoe

Tic-tac-toe or noughts and crosses is a game where two players take turns marking an empty cell in a 3 x 3 grid with their respective tokens. Each player has either an X token or an O token. A player wins whenever they place three of their tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid. A draw occurs when all the cells on the grid have been filled with tokens and neither player has won.
